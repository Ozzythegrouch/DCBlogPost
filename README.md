Hello my name is Oscar, starting this new journey with Digital Crafts Coding Bootcamp. Learning about the Terminal on a Mac and its purpose.

The CLI, command line interface, is what was used before we had the easy to use GUI. Different commands are used to execute functions.
All comands in the Terminal are case sensitive. 
The terminal is the shell that interprets and runs commands.

mkdir = makes a directory, a file in the location you are in.

pwd = identifies the location you are in the terminal.

ls = lists all the files that are in the current directory

You can also add additional parameters to your commands like -a, -f, -l.

-l added to ls would give you longer version of the items.
-a shows the hidden files in the directory.
-f forces the execution of the command with no safety parameter.
-f could potentially erase your whole computer.

When you use the ls commamnd it lists the files plus more information like date created, type of file, size.
d identifies the file as a directory which could potentially have more files inside
w identifies that the file is writable
r identifies that the file is readable

Command 1 - nano opens up the terminal editor, not sure what I can do in there. I'm guessing its to edit files that are not txt.

Command 2 - df -h shows you the available disk space on your computer

Command 3 - ditto -V [folder path][new folder] allow you to copy all the files in a folder to a new folder. THe -V shows you the names of the files that were copied into the new folder.
